Corectl is a command line tool to perform reloads, fetch metadata and evaluate expressions in Qlik Core apps. <br>

## Running coreCtl on you local machine
If you want to run coreCtl locally on you machine see the [coreCtl documentation](https://github.com/qlik-oss/corectl) to install corectl.

You will also need a engine running in a docker container. If you are unfamiliar with docker you can read more about [docker containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) after the tutorial. <br>

If you are curious about what docker-compose file we use in this example you can `../docker-compose.yml`{{open}}

**However in this tutorial you don't have to worry about docker or installing corectl everything is preinstalled in the environment.**
