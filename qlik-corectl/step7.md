To load two or more files we need to do two things: 
1. We need to setup a connection to each file. 
2. We need to change the load script so it loads both files.
<br>

Create a connection that connects both to the url to the movies info and the folder connection to the /data folder.

<pre class="file" data-filename="corectl.yml" data-target="replace">
engine: localhost:19076 
app: myapp  
script: webload.qvs 
connections: 
 webdata: 
      connectionstring: 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/carlioth/b86ede12e75b5756c9f34c0d65a22bb3/raw/e733b74c7c1c5494669b36893a31de5427b7b4fc/MovieInfo.csv'
      type: internet 
 testdata: 
      connectionstring: /data 
      type: folder 
</pre>

</p>
</details>

Create a load script that appends both load files together.

We already have the load scripts for both this files ready so we just merge both script files to one. Lets append the Movies loadscript to the webscript.qvs:

<pre class="file" data-filename="webload.qvs" data-target="append">
Movies:
LOAD *
FROM [lib://testdata/movies.csv]
(txt, utf8, embedded labels, delimiter is ',');
</pre>
</p>
</details>

First we need to rebuild the app `corectl build`{{execute}}.

Run: `corectl tables`{{execute}}!!

There is now two tables in our app!
<br>

## Associations
<br>

Checkout: [catwalk](https://catwalk.core.qlik.com/?engine_url=wss://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-19076-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/home/engine/Qlik/Sense/Apps/myapp).
<br>

As you can see we now have relation in within our tables. Catwalk will automatically relate fields with the same name which is very powerful when adding a lot of table and when the data system are more complex.
<br>

You can see the associations between tables with: `corectl assoc`{{execute}}
